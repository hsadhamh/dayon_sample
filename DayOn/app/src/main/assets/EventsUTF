A bodhisattva who has accomplished this goal is called a samyaksaṃbuddha, or \"fully enlightened Buddha\". A samyaksaṃbuddha can establish the Dharma and lead disciples to enlightenment.

He was a key figure in the introduction of the Indian philosophies of Vedanta and Yoga to the Western world and is credited with raising interfaith awareness, bringing Hinduism to the status of a major world religion during the late 19th century. He was a major force in the revival of Hinduism in India, and contributed to the concept of nationalism in colonial India. Vivekananda founded the Ramakrishna Math and the Ramakrishna Mission.

He was influenced by his Guru, Ramakrishna Deva, from whom he learnt that all living beings were an embodiment of the divine self; therefore, service to God could be rendered by service to mankind. After Ramakrishna's death, Vivekananda toured the Indian subcontinent extensively and acquired first-hand knowledge of the conditions prevailing in British India. He later travelled to the United States, representing India at the 1893 Parliament of the World Religions.

Bose was a twice-elected President of the Indian National Congress, founder and President of the All India Forward Bloc, and founder and Head of State of the Provisional Government of Free India, which he led alongside the Indian National Army from 1943 until his death in 1945. Bose is perhaps best known for his advocacy and leadership of an armed struggle for Indian independence against the British Empire, as well as his early calls for Purna Swaraj, or complete self-rule, for the people of India. Bose's The honorific Netaji, first applied to Bose in Germany, by the Indian soldiers of the Indische Legion and by the German and Indian officials in the Special Bureau for India in Berlin, in early 1942, was by 1990 used widely throughout India.\n Earlier, Bose had been a leader of the younger, radical, wing of the Indian National Congress in the late 1920s and 1930s, rising to become Congress President in 1938 and 1939. However, he was ousted from Congress leadership positions in 1939 following differences with Mohandas K. Gandhi and the Congress high command. He was subsequently placed under house arrest by the British before escaping from India in 1940.\n Bose arrived in Germany in April 1941, where the leadership offered unexpected, if sometimes ambivalent, sympathy for the cause of India's independence, contrasting starkly with its attitudes towards other colonised peoples and ethnic communities. In November 1941, with German funds, a Free India Centre was set up in Berlin, and soon a Free India Radio, on which Bose broadcast nightly. A 3,000-strong Free India Legion, comprising Indians captured by Erwin Rommel's Afrika Korps, was also formed to aid in a possible future German land invasion of India. During this time Bose also became a father; his wife, or companion, Emilie Schenkl, whom he had met in 1934, gave birth to a baby girl. By spring 1942, in light of Japanese victories in southeast Asia and changing German priorities, a German invasion of India became untenable, and Bose became keen to move to southeast Asia. Adolf Hitler, during his only meeting with Bose in late May 1942, suggested the same, and offered to arrange for a submarine. Identifying strongly with the Axis powers, and no longer apologetically, Bose boarded a German submarine in February 1943. In Madagascar, he was transferred to a Japanese submarine from which he disembarked in Japanese-held Sumatra in May 1943.\n With Japanese support, Bose revamped the Indian National Army (INA), then composed of Indian soldiers of the British Indian army who had been captured in the Battle of Singapore. To these, after Bose's arrival, were added enlisting Indian civilians in Malaya and Singapore. The Japanese had come to support a number of puppet and provisional governments in the captured regions, such as those in Burma, the Philippines and Manchukuo. Before long the Provisional Government of Free India, presided by Bose, was formed in the Japanese-occupied Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Bose had great drive and charisma—creating popular Indian slogans, such as \"Jai Hind,\"—and the INA under Bose was a model of diversity by region, ethnicity, religion, and even gender. However, Bose was regarded by the Japanese as being militarily unskilled, and his military effort was short lived. In late 1944 and early 1945 the British Indian Army first halted and then devastatingly reversed the Japanese attack on India. Almost half the Japanese forces and fully half the participating INA contingent were killed. The INA was driven down the Malay Peninsula, and surrendered with the recapture of Singapore. Bose had earlier chosen not to surrender with his forces or with the Japanese, but rather to escape to Manchuria with a view to seeking a future in the Soviet Union which he believed to be turning anti-British. He died from third degree burns received when his plane crashed in Taiwan. Some Indians, however, did not believe that the crash had occurred, with many among them, especially in Bengal, believing that Bose would return to gain India's independence.\n The Indian National Congress, the main instrument of Indian nationalism, praised Bose's patriotism but distanced itself from his tactics and ideology, especially his collaboration with Fascism. The British Raj, though never seriously threatened by the INA, charged 300 INA officers with treason in the INA trials, but eventually backtracked in the face both of popular sentiment and of its own end.","recur":{"type":"DAY","value":1},"created_at":1476592678,"modified_at":1476592678},"category":5,"sub_category":0,"locations":[{"state":"Assam","country":"India"},{"state":"Odisha","country":"India"},{"state":"Tripura","country":"India"},{"state":"West Bengal","country":"India"}],"flags":0,"tags":[]},{"id":10,"euid":"eve11","name":"Sir Chhotu Ram Jayanti","property":{"webref":{"type":"WIKI","value":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chhotu_Ram"},"description":"Rao Bahadur Sir Chhotu Ram, (24 November 1881 – 9 January 1945) was one of the most prominent pre-partition politicians in Punjab and an ideologue of the Jat peasantry and a champion of its interests.

He was a profound scholar of the Vedic lore and Sanskrit language. He was the first to give the call for Swarajya as \"India for Indians\" – in 1876, later taken up by Lokmanya Tilak. Denouncing the idolatry and ritualistic worship prevalent in Hinduism at the time, he worked towards reviving Vedic ideologies. Subsequently the philosopher and President of India, S. Radhakrishnan, called him one of the \"makers of Modern India,\" as did Sri Aurobindo.\n Those who were influenced by and followed Dayananda included Madam Cama, Pandit Lekh Ram, Swami Shradhanand, Pandit Guru Dutt Vidyarthi, Shyam Krishan Verma (who established India House in England for Freedom fighters) Vinayak Damodar Savarkar, Lala Hardayal, Madan Lal Dhingra, Ram Prasad Bismil, Mahadev Govind Ranade Swami Shraddhanand, Mahatma Hansraj, Lala Lajpat Rai and others. One of his most influential works is the book Satyarth Prakash, which contributed to the Indian independence movement. He was a sanyasi (ascetic) from boyhood, and a scholar, who believed in the infallible authority of the Vedas.\n Maharshi Dayananda advocated the doctrine of Karma (Karmasiddhanta in Hinduism) and Reincarnation (Punarjanma in Hinduism). He emphasized the Vedic ideals of brahmacharya (celibacy) and devotion to God.

It is the day Shiva was married to the goddess Parvati. The Maha Shivaratri festival, also popularly known as 'Shivaratri' (spelt as Sivaratri, Shivaratri, Sivarathri, and Shivarathri) or 'Great Night of Shiva', marks the convergence of Shiva and Shakti. Maha Shivaratri is celebrated on the Krishna Paksha Chaturdashi of Hindu calendar month Maagha as per Amavasya-ant month calculation. As per Poornima-ant month calculation, the day is Krishna Paksha Chaturdashi of Hindu calendar month Phalguna which falls in February or March as per the Gregorian calendar. Of the twelve Shivaratris in the year, the Maha Shivarathri is the most holy.\n The festival is principally celebrated by offerings of Bael leaves to Shiva, all-day fasting and an all-night-vigil (jagaran). All through the day, devotees chant \"Om Namah Shivaya\", the sacred mantra of Shiva. Penances are performed in order to gain boons in the practice of Yoga and meditation, in order to reach life's highest good steadily and swiftly. On this day, the planetary positions in the Northern hemisphere act as potent catalysts to help a person raise his or her spiritual energy more easily. The benefits of powerful ancient Sanskrit mantras such as Maha Mrityunjaya Mantra increase greatly on this night.\n In Nepal, millions of Hindus attend Shivaratri together from different part of the world at the famous Pashupatinath Temple. Thousands of devotees also attend Mahasivaratri at the famous Shiva Shakti Peetham of Nepal.\n In Indo-Caribbean communities throughout the West Indies, thousands of Hindus spend the auspicious night in over 400 temples across the country, offering special jhalls to Lord Shiva.\n On Maha Shivaratri, Nishita Kala is the ideal time to observe Shiva Pooja. Nishita Kala celebrates when Lord Shiva appeared on the Earth in the form of Linga. On this day, in all Shiva temples, the most auspicious Lingodbhava Puja is performed.","recur":{"value":0},"religion":"Hindu","created_at":1476592678,"modified_at":1476592678},"category":7,"sub_category":0,"locations":[{"state":"Andhra Pradesh","country":"India"},{"state":"Chhattisgarh","country":"India"},{"state":"Gujarat","country":"India"},{"state":"Haryana","country":"India"},{"state":"Himachal Pradesh","country":"India"},{"state":"Jammu and Kashmir","country":"India"},{"state":"Jharkhand","country":"India"},{"state":"Karnataka","country":"India"},{"state":"Kerala","country":"India"},{"state":"Madhya Pradesh","country":"India"},{"state":"Maharashtra","country":"India"},{"state":"Odisha","country":"India"},{"state":"Telangana","country":"India"},{"state":"Tripura","country":"India"},{"state":"Uttar Pradesh","country":"India"},{"state":"Uttarakhand","country":"India"}],"flags":0,"tags":[]},{"id":20,"euid":"eve21","name":"Doljatra / Holika Dahan / Holi","property":{"webref":{"type":"WIKI","value":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holi"},"description":"Holi (pronunciation: /ˈhoʊliː/; Sanskrit: होली Holī) is a spring festival, also known as the festival of colours or the festival of love. It is an ancient Hindu religious festival which has become popular with non-Hindus in many parts of South Asia, as well as people of other communities outside Asia.\n It is primarily observed in India, Nepal, and other regions of the world with significant populations of Hindus or people of Indian origin. In recent years the festival has spread to parts of Europe and North America as a spring celebration of love, frolic, and colours.\n Holi celebrations start on the night before Holi with a Holika bonfire where people gather, sing and dance. The next morning is a free-for-all carnival of colours, where participants play, chase and colour each other with dry powder and coloured water, with some carrying water guns and coloured water-filled balloons for their water fight. Anyone and everyone is fair game, friend or stranger, rich or poor, man or woman, children and elders. The frolic and fight with colours occurs in the open streets, open parks, outside temples and buildings. Groups carry drums and musical instruments, go from place to place, sing and dance. People visit family, friends and foes to throw colours on each other, laugh and chit-chat, then share Holi delicacies, food and drinks. Some drinks are intoxicating. For example, Bhang, an intoxicating ingredient made from cannabis leaves, is mixed into drinks and sweets and consumed by many. In the evening, after sobering up, people dress up and visit friends and family.\n Holi is celebrated at the approach of the vernal equinox, on the Phalguna Purnima (Full Moon). The festival date varies every year, per the Hindu calendar, and typically comes in March, sometimes February in the Gregorian Calendar. The festival signifies the victory of good over evil, the arrival of spring, end of winter, and for many a festive day to meet others, play and laugh, forget and forgive, and repair broken relationships, and is also celebrated as a thanksgiving for a good harvest.","recur":{"value":0},"religion":"Christian","created_at":1476592678,"modified_at":1476592678},"category":7,"sub_category":0,"locations":[{"state":"Goa","country":"India"},{"state":"Assam","country":"India"},{"state":"Bihar","country":"India"},{"state":"Chhattisgarh","country":"India"},{"state":"Delhi","country":"India"},{"state":"Goa","country":"India"},{"state":"Gujarat","country":"India"},{"state":"Haryana","country":"India"},{"state":"Himachal Pradesh","country":"India"},{"state":"Jammu and Kashmir","country":"India"},{"state":"Jharkhand","country":"India"},{"state":"Madhya Pradesh","country":"India"},{"state":"Maharashtra","country":"India"},{"state":"Manipur","country":"India"},{"state":"Mizoram","country":"India"},{"state":"Odisha","country":"India"},{"state":"Punjab","country":"India"},{"state":"Rajasthan","country":"India"},{"state":"Sikkim","country":"India"},{"state":"Tripura","country":"India"},{"state":"Uttar Pradesh","country":"India"},{"state":"Uttarakhand","country":"India"},{"state":"Odisha","country":"India"},{"state":"Uttar Pradesh","country":"India"},{"state":"West Bengal","country":"India"}],"flags":0,"tags":[]},{"id":21,"euid":"eve22","name":"Magha Puja Day","property":{"webref":{"type":"WIKI","value":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magha_Puja"},"description":"Māgha Pūjā, Makha Bucha, or the Full Moon of Tabodwe (Burmese: တပို့တွဲလပြည့်နေ့ ; Khmer: មាឃបូជា, Meak Bochea; Lao: ມະຄະບູຊາ; Thai: มาฆบูชา) is an important Buddhist festival celebrated on the full moon day of Māgha in Cambodia, Laos, and Thailand, and on the full moon day of Tabodwe in Myanmar.

He worked with several revolutionary organisations and became prominent in the Hindustan Republican Association (HRA), which changed its name to the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA) in 1928.\n Seeking revenge for the death of Lala Lajpat Rai, Singh murdered John Saunders, a British police officer. He eluded efforts by the police to capture him. Soon after, together with Batukeshwar Dutt, he and an accomplice threw two bombs and leaflets inside the Central Legislative Assembly. The two men were arrested, as they had planned. Held in jail on a charge of murder, he gained widespread national support when he undertook a 116-day fast demanding equal rights for European prisoners, and those Indians imprisoned for what he believed were political reasons. During this period, sufficient evidence was brought against him for a conviction in the Saunders case after trial by Special Tribunal, and an appeal to the Privy Council in England. He was convicted and subsequently hanged for his participation in the murder at the age of 23.\n His legacy prompted youth in India to continue fighting for independence and he remains an influence on some young people in modern India, as well as the inspiration for several films. He is commemorated with a range of memorials including a large bronze statue in the Parliament of India.","recur":{"type":"DAY","value":1},"created_at":1476592678,"modified_at":1476592678},"category":4,"sub_category":0,"locations":[],"flags":0,"tags":[]},{"id":23,"euid":"eve24","name":"Ugadi / Gudi Padwa / Telugu New Year","property":{"webref":{"type":"WIKI","value":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ugadi"},"description":"Yugādi,(Ugādi 'Samvatsarādi Telugu: Ugadi/Yugadi ఉగాది, Kannada: ಯುಗಾದಿ Yugadi, Konkani/Marathi: युगादि yugādi and Gudi padwa in marathi) is the New Year's Day for the people of the Deccan region of India.

After the war between Nepal and Britain, also known as the Anglo-Gorkha War (1814–1816), the British colonial government came into power and the land now comprising Himachal Pradesh became part of the Punjab Province of British India. In 1950, Himachal was declared a union territory, but after the State of Himachal Pradesh Act 1971, Himachal emerged as the 18th state of the Republic of India. Hima means snow in Sanskrit, and the literal meaning of the state's name is \"In the lap of Himalayas\". It was named by Acharya Diwakar Datt Sharma, one of the great Sanskrit scholars of Himachal Pradesh.\n The economy of Himachal Pradesh is currently the third-fastest growing economy in India. Himachal Pradesh has been ranked fourth in the list of the highest per capita incomes of Indian states. This has made it one of the most wealthiest places in entire South Asia. Abundance of perennial rivers enables Himachal to sell hydroelectricity to other states such as Delhi, Punjab, and Rajasthan. The economy of the state is highly dependent on three sources: hydroelectric power, tourism, and agriculture.\n Himachal Pradesh is spread across valleys, and 90% of the population lives in villages and towns. However, the state has achieved 100% hygiene and practically no single house is without a toilet. The villages are well connected to roads, public health centers, and now with Lokmitra kendra using high-speed broadband. Shimla district has maximum urban population of 25%.

Author of Gitanjali and its \"profoundly sensitive, fresh and beautiful verse\", he became the first non-European to win the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1913. In translation his poetry was viewed as spiritual and mercurial; however, his \"elegant prose and magical poetry\" remain largely unknown outside Bengal. Tagore introduced new prose and verse forms and the use of colloquial language into Bengali literature, thereby freeing it from traditional models based on classical Sanskrit. He was highly influential in introducing the best of Indian culture to the West and vice versa, and he is generally regarded as the outstanding creative artist of the modern Indian subcontinent.\n A Pirali Brahmin from Calcutta with ancestral gentry roots in Jessore, Tagore wrote poetry as an eight-year-old. At age sixteen, he released his first substantial poems under the pseudonym Bhānusiṃha (\"Sun Lion\"), which were seized upon by literary authorities as long-lost classics. By 1877 he graduated to his first short stories and dramas, published under his real name. As a humanist, universalist internationalist, and strident nationalist he denounced the British Raj and advocated independence from Britain. As an exponent of the Bengal Renaissance, he advanced a vast canon that comprised paintings, sketches and doodles, hundreds of texts, and some two thousand songs; his legacy endures also in the institution he founded, Visva-Bharati University.\n Tagore modernised Bengali art by spurning rigid classical forms and resisting linguistic strictures. His novels, stories, songs, dance-dramas, and essays spoke to topics political and personal. Gitanjali (Song Offerings), Gora (Fair-Faced) and Ghare-Baire (The Home and the World) are his best-known works, and his verse, short stories, and novels were acclaimed—or panned—for their lyricism, colloquialism, naturalism, and unnatural contemplation. His compositions were chosen by two nations as national anthems: India's Jana Gana Mana and Bangladesh's Amar Shonar Bangla. The lyrics and music for the original song of Sri Lanka's National Anthem were also the work of Tagore.","recur":{"type":"DAY","value":1},"created_at":1476592678,"modified_at":1476592678},"category":5,"sub_category":0,"locations":[{"state":"Assam","country":"India"},{"state":"Bihar","country":"India"},{"state":"Goa","country":"India"},{"state":"Jharkhand","country":"India"},{"state":"Karnataka","country":"India"},{"state":"Kerala","country":"India"},{"state":"Manipur","country":"India"},{"state":"Tamil Nadu","country":"India"},{"state":"Tripura","country":"India"},{"state":"West Bengal","country":"India"}],"flags":0,"tags":[]},{"id":51,"euid":"eve52","name":"Buddha Purnima","property":{"webref":{"type":"WIKI","value":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vesak"},"description":"Buddha Purnima/Vesak in India.

This annual observance is regarded as one of the Five Pillars of Islam. The month lasts 29–30 days based on the visual sightings of the crescent moon, according to numerous biographical accounts compiled in the hadiths.\n The word Ramadan comes from the Arabic root ramiḍa or ar-ramaḍ, which means scorching heat or dryness. Fasting is fardh (obligatory) for adult Muslims, except those who are suffering from an illness, travelling, are elderly, pregnant, breastfeeding, diabetic or going through menstrual bleeding. Fasting the month of Ramadan was made obligatory (wājib) during the month of Sha'aban, in the second year after the Muslims migrated from Mecca to Medina. Fatwas have been issued declaring that Muslims who live in regions with natural phenomenon such as the midnight sun or polar night should follow the timetable of Mecca.\n While fasting from dawn until sunset, Muslims refrain from consuming food, drinking liquids, smoking, and engaging in sexual relations with one's spouse. Muslims are also instructed to refrain from sinful behavior that may negate the reward of fasting, such as false speech (insulting, backbiting, cursing, lying, etc.) and fighting. Food and drink is served daily, before dawn and after sunset. Spiritual rewards (thawab) for fasting are also believed to be multiplied within the month of Ramadan. Fasting for Muslims during Ramadan typically includes the increased offering of salat (prayers) and recitation of the Quran.","recur":{"value":0},"religion":"Jewish","created_at":1476592678,"modified_at":1476592678},"category":6,"sub_category":0,"locations":[],"flags":0,"tags":[]},{"id":59,"euid":"eve60","name":"Shavuot (1st day)","property":{"webref":{"type":"WIKI","value":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shavuot"},"description":"Shavuot ( listen ) (or Shovuos ( listen ), in Ashkenazi usage; Shavuʿoth in Sephardi and Mizrahi Hebrew (Hebrew: שבועות‎‎, lit. \"Weeks\"), known as the Feast of Weeks in English and as Pentecost (Πεντηκοστή) in Ancient Greek, is a Jewish holiday that occurs on the sixth day of the Hebrew month of Sivan (may fall between 14 May–15 June).\n Shavuot has a double significance.

He was born in Goindval, Punjab the youngest son of Guru Ram Das and Mata Bhani, the daughter of Guru Amar Das.\n Guru Arjan lived as the Guru of Sikhism for a quarter of a century. He completed the construction of Amritsar and founded other cities, such as Taran Taran and Kartarpur. The greatest contribution Guru Arjan made to the Sikh faith was to compile all of the past Gurus' writings, along with selected writings of other saints from different backgrounds which he considered consistent with the teachings of Sikhism into one book, now the holy scripture: the Guru Granth Sahib. It is, perhaps, the only script which still exists in the form first published (a hand-written manuscript) by the Guru.\n Guru Arjan introduced the Masands, a group of representatives who taught and spread the teachings of the Gurus and received the Dasvand, a voluntary offering of a Sikh's income in money, goods or service. Sikhs paid the Dasvand to support the building of gurdwaras and langars (shared communal kitchens). Although the introduction of the langar was started by Guru Nanak, Guru Arjan is credited for laying the foundation of the systematic institution of langars as a religious duty, one that has continued ever since.\n Guru Arjan was arrested under the orders of the Mughal Emperor Jahangir and asked to convert to Islam. He refused, was tortured and executed in 1606 CE. Historical records and the Sikh tradition are unclear whether Guru Arjan was executed by drowning or died during torture. His martyrdom is considered a watershed event in the history of Sikhism.","recur":{"value":0},"religion":"Jewish","created_at":1476592678,"modified_at":1476592678},"category":6,"sub_category":0,"locations":[],"flags":0,"tags":[]},{"id":64,"euid":"eve65","name":"Laylat al Kadr","property":{"webref":{"type":"WIKI","value":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laylat_al-Qadr"},"description":"Laylat al-Qadr (Arabic: لیلة القدر‎) (also known as Shab-e-Qadr , loaned from Persian), variously rendered in English as the Night of Decree, Night of Power, Night of Value, Night of Destiny, or Night of Measures, is in Islamic belief the night when the first verses of the Quran were revealed to the Islamic prophet Muhammad.

This doctrine was dogmatically defined by Pope Pius XII on November 1, 1950, in the apostolic constitution Munificentissimus Deus by exercising papal infallibility. While the Catholic Church and Eastern Orthodox Church believe in the Dormition of the Theotokos, which is the same as the Assumption, the alleged physical death of Mary has not been dogmatically defined.\n In Munificentissimus Deus (item 39) Pope Pius XII pointed to the Book of Genesis (3:15) as scriptural support for the dogma in terms of Mary's victory over sin and death as also reflected in 1 Corinthians 15:54: \"then shall come to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory\".\n In the churches that observe it, the Assumption is a major feast day, commonly celebrated on August 15.

Iranians rebelled against Arab invaders for almost 200 years; in Iran this period is now known as the \"Two Centuries of Silence\" or \"Period of Silence\". During this time many Iranians who are now called Parsi rejected both options and instead chose to take refuge by fleeing from Iran to India.\n The word \"Parsi\" in the Persian language literally means Persian. Persian is the official language of modern Iran, which was formerly known as Persia, and the Persian language's endonym is Farsi, a variation of the word Parsi.\n The long presence of the Parsis in the Gujarat and Sindh areas of India distinguishes them from the smaller Zoroastrian Indian community of Iranis, who are much more recent arrivals, mostly descended from Zoroastrians fleeing the repression of the Qajar dynasty and the general social and political tumult of late 19th- and early 20th-century Iran.","recur":{"value":0},"religion":"Hindu","created_at":1476592678,"modified_at":1476592678},"category":7,"sub_category":0,"locations":[{"state":"Gujarat","country":"India"},{"state":"Rajasthan","country":"India"},{"state":"Uttar Pradesh","country":"India"},{"state":"Uttarakhand","country":"India"}],"flags":0,"tags":[]},{"id":83,"euid":"eve84","name":"Teej","property":{"webref":{"type":"WIKI","value":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teej"},"description":"Teej (छत्तीसगढ़ी : तीजा (Devanagari) (Nepali: तीज); (Punjabi: ਤੀਜ (Gurmukhi)), and (Hindi: तीज) is a generic name for a number of festivals that are celebrated in Nepal, Northern and Western India.

It honors the willingness of Abraham (Ibrahim) to sacrifice his son Ishmael, as an act of submission to God's command, before God then intervened, through his angel Jibra'il and informs him that his sacrifice has already been accepted. The meat from the sacrificed animal is preferred to be divided into three parts. The family retains one third of the share; another third is given to relatives, friends and neighbors; and the remaining third is given to the poor and needy.\n In the lunar-based Islamic calendar, Eid al-Adha falls on the 10th day of Dhu al-Hijjah and lasts for four days. In the international (Gregorian) calendar, the dates vary from year to year, drifting approximately 11 days earlier each year.\n Eid al-Adha is the latter of the two Eid holidays, the former being Eid al-Fitr. The basis for the observance comes from the 196th ayah (verse) of Al-Baqara, the second sura of the Quran. The word \"Eid\" appears once in Al-Ma'ida, the fifth sura of the Quran, with the meaning \"solemn festival\".\n Like Eid al-Fitr, Eid al-Adha begins with a Sunnah prayer of two rakats followed by a sermon (khutbah). Eid al-Adha celebrations start after the descent of the Hujjaj, the pilgrims performing the Hajj, from Mount Arafat, a hill east of Mecca. Eid sacrifice may take place until sunset on the 13th day of Dhu al-Hijjah. The days of Eid have been singled out in the Hadith as \"days of remembrance\". The takbir (days) of Tashriq are from the Fajr prayer of the 9th of Dhu al-Hijjah up to the Asr prayer of the 13th of Dhu al-Hijjah (5 days and 4 nights).

The first Islamic year begins in 622 AD with the emigration of Prophet Muhammad from Mecca to Medina, known as the Hijra. All religious duties, such as prayer, fasting in the month of Ramadan, and pilgrimage, and the dates of significant events, such as celebration of holy nights and festivals, are calculated according to the lunar calendar.\n While some Islamic organizations prefer determining the new month (and hence the new year) by local sightings of the moon, most Islamic institutions and countries, including Saudi Arabia, follow astronomical calculations to determine future dates of the Islamic calendar. There are various schema for calculating the tabular Islamic calendar (i.e. not based on observation), which results in differences of typically one or even two days between countries using such schema and those that use lunar sightings. For example, the The Umm al-Qura Calendar used in Saudi Arabia was reformed several times in recent years. The current scheme has been introduced in 1423 AH (15 March 2002).\n A day in the Islamic calendar is defined as beginning at sunset. For example, 1 Muharram 1432 was defined to correspond to 7 or 8 December 2010 in official calendars (depending on the country). For an observation-based calendar, a sighting of the new moon at sunset of 6 December would mean that 1 Muharram lasted from the moment of sunset of 6 December to the moment of sunset of 7 December, while in places where the new moon was not sighted on 6 December, 1 Muharram would last from the moment of sunset of 7 December to the moment of sunset of 8 December. الله اکبر","recur":{"value":0},"religion":"Hindu","created_at":1476592678,"modified_at":1476592678},"category":6,"sub_category":0,"locations":[],"flags":0,"tags":[]},{"id":97,"euid":"eve98","name":"Haryana's Heroes' Martyrdom Day","property":{"webref":{"type":"WIKI","value":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martyrs%27_Day_(India)"},"description":"A martyr (Greek: μάρτυς, mártys, \"witness\"; stem μάρτυρ-, mártyr-) is somebody who suffers persecution and death for advocating, renouncing, refusing to renounce, or refusing to advocate a belief or cause as demanded by an external party.

The festival falls on the ninth day or Navami of the bright half of Moon's cycle of 15 days (as per Almanac) in the month of September/October, and is popularly a part of the Dasara or Navaratri or Durga Puja or Golu festival. On the ninth day of the Dasara festival, weapons and tools are worshipped. In Karnataka, the celebration is for killing of the demon king Mahishasura by goddess Chamundeshwari. After slaying of the demon king, the weapons were kept out for worship. While Navaratri festival is observed all over the country but in South Indian states, where it is widely celebrated as Ayudha Puja, there are slight variations of worship procedure.\n The principal Shakti goddesses worshiped during the Ayudha puja are Saraswati (the Goddess of wisdom, arts and literature), Lakshmi (the goddess of wealth) and Parvati (the divine mother), apart from various types of equipment; it is on this occasion when weapons are worshipped by soldiers and tools are revered by artisans. The Puja is considered a meaningful custom, which focuses specific attention to one’s profession and its related tools and connotes that a divine force is working behind it to perform well and for getting the proper reward.\n In the cross cultural development that has revolutionized the society, with modern science making a lasting impact on the scientific knowledge and industrial base in India, the ethos of the old religious order is retained by worship of computers and typewriters also during the Ayudha Puja, in the same manner as practiced in the past for weapons of warfare.

As stated in Leviticus, it is also intended as a reminiscence of the type of fragile dwellings in which the Israelites dwelt during their 40 years of travel in the desert after the Exodus from slavery in Egypt.

The one mentioned in the Book of Exodus is agricultural in nature – \"Feast of Ingathering at the year's end\" (Exodus 34:22) – and marks the end of the harvest time and thus of the agricultural year in the Land of Israel. The more elaborate religious significance from the Book of Leviticus is that of commemorating the Exodus and the dependence of the People of Israel on the will of God (Leviticus 23:42-43).\n The holiday lasts seven days in Israel and eight in the diaspora. The first day (and second day in the diaspora) is a Shabbat-like holiday when work is forbidden, followed by intermediate days called Chol Hamoed. The festival is closed with another Shabbat-like holiday called Shemini Atzeret (two days in the diaspora, where the second day is called Simchat Torah).\n The Hebrew word sukkōt is the plural of sukkah, \"booth\" or \"tabernacle\", which is a walled structure covered with s'chach (plant material such as overgrowth or palm leaves). A sukkah is the name of the temporary dwelling in which farmers would live during harvesting, a fact connecting to the agricultural significance of the holiday stressed by the Book of Exodus. As stated in Leviticus, it is also intended as a reminiscence of the type of fragile dwellings in which the Israelites dwelt during their 40 years of travel in the desert after the Exodus from slavery in Egypt. Throughout the holiday, meals are eaten inside the sukkah and many people sleep there as well.\n On each day of the holiday it is mandatory to perform a waving ceremony with the Four Species.","recur":{"value":0},"religion":"Hindu","created_at":1476592678,"modified_at":1476592678},"category":7,"sub_category":0,"locations":[{"state":"Odisha","country":"India"},{"state":"Tripura","country":"India"},{"state":"West Bengal","country":"India"}],"flags":0,"tags":[]},{"id":116,"euid":"eve117","name":"Shemini Atzeret","property":{"webref":{"type":"WIKI","value":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shemini_Atzeret"},"description":"Shemini Atzeret (שְׁמִינִי עֲצֶרֶת – \"Eighth [day of] Assembly\"; Sefardic/Israeli pron. shemini atzèret; Ashkenazic pron. shmini-atsères) is a Jewish holiday. It is celebrated on the 22nd day of the Hebrew month of Tishrei in the Land of Israel, and on the 22nd and 23rd outside the Land, usually coinciding with late September and/or early October. It directly follows the Jewish festival of Sukkot which is celebrated for seven days, and thus Shemini Atzeret is literally the eighth day; it is a separate—yet connected—holy day devoted to the spiritual aspects of the festival of Sukkot. Part of its duality as a holy day is that it is simultaneously considered to be both connected to Sukkot and also a separate festival in its own right.\n Outside the Land of Israel, this is further complicated by the additional day added to all Biblical holidays except Yom Kippur. The first day of Shemini Atzeret therefore coincides with the eighth day of Sukkot outside of the Land of Israel, leading to sometimes involved analysis as to which practices of each holiday are to apply.\n The celebration of Simchat Torah is the most distinctive feature of the holiday, but it is a later rabbinical innovation. In the Land of Israel, the celebrations of Shemini Atzeret and Simchat Torah are combined on a single day, and the names are used interchangeably. In the Diaspora, the celebration of Simchat Torah is deferred to the second day of the holiday. Commonly, only the first day is referred to as Shemini Atzeret, while the second is called Simchat Torah.\n Karaites and Samaritans also observe Shemini Atzeret, as they do all Biblical holidays. However, it may occur on a different day from the conventional Jewish celebration, due to differences in calendar calculations. Karaites and Samaritans do not include the rabbinical innovation of Simchat Torah in their observance of the day.","recur":{"value":0},"created_at":1476592678,"modified_at":1476592678},"category":5,"sub_category":0,"locations":[{"state":"Delhi","country":"India"},{"state":"Haryana","country":"India"},{"state":"Himachal Pradesh","country":"India"},{"state":"Karnataka","country":"India"},{"state":"Punjab","country":"India"}],"flags":0,"tags":[]},{"id":117,"euid":"eve118","name":"Simhat Torah","property":{"webref":{"type":"WIKI","value":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simchat_Torah"},"description":"Simchat Torah or Simḥath Torah (also Simkhes Toreh, Hebrew: שִׂמְחַת תּוֹרָה, lit., \"Rejoicing of/[with the] Torah\") is a Jewish holiday that celebrates and marks the conclusion of the annual cycle of public Torah readings, and the beginning of a new cycle. Simchat Torah is a component of the Biblical Jewish holiday of Shemini Atzeret (\"Eighth Day of Assembly\"), which follows immediately after the festival of Sukkot in the month of Tishrei (occurring in mid-September to early October on the Gregorian calendar).\n The main celebration of Simchat Torah takes place in the synagogue during evening and morning services. In Orthodox as well as many Conservative congregations, this is the only time of year on which the Torah scrolls are taken out of the ark and read at night. In the morning, the last parashah of Deuteronomy and the first parashah of Genesis are read in the synagogue. On each occasion, when the ark is opened, the worshippers leave their seats to dance and sing with the Torah scrolls in a joyous celebration that can last for several hours.\n The morning service is also uniquely characterized by the calling up of each male member (in some Orthodox, and in the majority of non-Orthodox congregations, male and female members) of the congregation for an aliyah. There is also a special aliyah for all the children (under 13 or 12 for boys and girls).","recur":{"value":0},"religion":"Jewish","created_at":1476592678,"modified_at":1476592678},"category":6,"sub_category":0,"locations":[],"flags":0,"tags":[]},{"id":118,"euid":"eve119","name":"Dhan Teras","property":{"webref":{"type":"WIKI","value":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhanteras"},"description":"Dhanteras ( Hindi : धनतेरस, Sanskrit/Marathi : धनत्रयोदशी) is the first day of the five-day Diwali Festival as celebrated in India.

The liturgical celebration begins at Vespers on the evening of 31 October and ends at the close of 1 November. It is thus the day before All Souls' Day.\n Hallowmas is another term for the feast, and was used by Shakespeare in this sense. However, a few recent writers have applied this term to the three days from 31 October to 2 November inclusive, as a synonym for the triduum of Hallowtide.\n In Catholic theology, the day commemorates all those who have attained the beatific vision in Heaven. It is a national holiday in many historically Catholic countries. In the Catholic Church and many Anglican churches, the next day specifically commemorates the departed faithful who have not yet been purified and reached Heaven. Christians who celebrate All Saints' Day and All Souls' Day do so in the fundamental belief that there is a prayerful spiritual bond between those in heaven (the \"Church triumphant\"), and the living (the \"Church militant\"). Other Christian traditions define, remember and respond to the saints in different ways; for example, in the Methodist Church, the word \"saints\" refers to all Christians and therefore, on All Saints' Day, the Church Universal, as well as the deceased members of a local congregation, are honored and remembered.\n All Saints' Day may originate in the ancient Roman observation of 13 May, the Feast of the Lemures, in which malevolent and restless spirits of the dead were propitiated. Liturgiologists base the idea that this Lemuria festival was the origin of that of All Saints on their identical dates and on the similar theme of \"all the dead\".\n In the British Isles, it is known that churches were already celebrating All Saints on 1 November at the beginning of the 8th century to coincide or replace the Celtic festival of Samhain. James Frazer suggests that 1 November was chosen because it was the date of the Celtic festival of the dead (Samhain) – the Celts had influenced their English neighbours, and English missionaries had influenced the Germans. However, Ronald Hutton points out that, according to Óengus of Tallaght (d. ca. 824), the 7th/8th century church in Ireland celebrated All Saints on 20 April. He suggests that 1 November date was a Germanic rather than a Celtic idea.","recur":{"type":"DAY","value":1},"religion":"Hindu","created_at":1476592678,"modified_at":1476592678},"category":6,"sub_category":0,"locations":[],"flags":0,"tags":[]},{"id":129,"euid":"eve130","name":"All Souls' Day","property":{"webref":{"type":"WIKI","value":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Souls%27_Day"},"description":"All Souls' Day, in Christianity, is a day commemorating the faithful departed, particularly but not exclusively one's relatives.

In Anglicanism it is called Commemoration of All Faithful Departed and is an optional celebration; Anglicans view All Souls' Day as an extension of the observance of All Saints' Day and it serves to \"remember those who have died\", in connection with the theological doctrines of the resurrection of the body and the Communion of Saints.

Mawlid is recognized as a national holiday in most of the Muslim-majority countries of the world except Saudi Arabia and Qatar which are officially Wahhabi/Salafi.","recur":{"value":0},"religion":"Christian","created_at":1476592678,"modified_at":1476592678},"category":6,"sub_category":0,"locations":[],"flags":0,"tags":[]},{"id":136,"euid":"eve137","name":"Advent - first Sunday","property":{"webref":{"type":"WIKI","value":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advent_Sunday"},"description":"Advent is a season observed in many Western Christian churches as a time of expectant waiting and preparation for the celebration of the Nativity of Jesus at Christmas. The term is an anglicized version of the Latin word adventus, meaning \"coming\".\n Latin adventus is the translation of the Greek word parousia, commonly used to refer to the Second Coming of Christ. For Christians, the season of Advent anticipates the coming of Christ from two different perspectives. The season offers the opportunity to share in the ancient longing for the coming of the Messiah, and to be alert for his Second Coming.\n Advent is the beginning of the Western liturgical year and commences on the fourth Sunday before Christmas, the Sunday nearest to St. Andrew's Day (30 November), in the Roman Rite of the Catholic Church, and in the Anglican, Lutheran, Moravian, Presbyterian and Methodist calendars, In the Ambrosian Rite and the Mozarabic Rite of the Catholic Church, Advent begins on the sixth Sunday before Christmas, the Sunday after St. Martin's Day (11 November).\n Practices associated with Advent include keeping an Advent calendar, lighting an Advent wreath, praying an Advent daily devotional, as well as other ways of preparing for Christmas, such as setting up Christmas decorations.\n The equivalent of Advent in Eastern Christianity is called the Nativity Fast, but it differs in length and observances, and does not begin the liturgical church year as it does in the West. The Eastern Nativity Fast does not use the equivalent parousia in its preparatory services.","recur":{"value":0},"religion":"Sikh","created_at":1476592678,"modified_at":1476592678},"category":7,"sub_category":0,"locations":[{"state":"Goa","country":"India"},{"state":"Assam","country":"India"},{"state":"Bihar","country":"India"},{"state":"Chhattisgarh","country":"India"},{"state":"Delhi","country":"India"},{"state":"Goa","country":"India"},{"state":"Gujarat","country":"India"},{"state":"Haryana","country":"India"},{"state":"Himachal Pradesh","country":"India"},{"state":"Jammu and Kashmir","country":"India"},{"state":"Jharkhand","country":"India"},{"state":"Kerala","country":"India"},{"state":"Madhya Pradesh","country":"India"},{"state":"Maharashtra","country":"India"},{"state":"Manipur","country":"India"},{"state":"Meghalaya","country":"India"},{"state":"Mizoram","country":"India"},{"state":"Nagaland","country":"India"},{"state":"Punjab","country":"India"},{"state":"Rajasthan","country":"India"},{"state":"Telangana","country":"India"},{"state":"Uttar Pradesh","country":"India"},{"state":"Uttarakhand","country":"India"},{"state":"West Bengal","country":"India"},{"state":"Haryana","country":"India"},{"state":"Himachal Pradesh","country":"India"},{"state":"Punjab","country":"India"}],"flags":0,"tags":[]},{"id":137,"euid":"eve138","name":"St. Nicholas Day","property":{"webref":{"type":"WIKI","value":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Nicholas_Day"},"description":"Saint Nicholas' Day, observed on December 6 (in Western Christian countries) and 19 December (in Eastern Christian countries), is the feast day of Saint Nicholas.

Christmas Day is observed around the world, and Christmas Eve is widely observed, by Christians and many others, as a full or partial holiday in anticipation of Christmas Day and together with it is considered one of the most culturally significant celebrations in Christendom and Western society.\n Christmas celebrations have long begun on the night of the 24th, due in part to the Christian liturgical day starting at sunset, a practice inherited from Jewish tradition and based on the story of Creation in the Book of Genesis: \"And there was evening, and there was morning – the first day.\" Many churches still ring their church bells and hold prayers in the evening; for example, the Nordic Lutheran churches. Since tradition holds that Jesus was born at night (based in Luke 2:6-8), Midnight Mass is celebrated on Christmas Eve, traditionally at midnight, in commemoration of his birth. The idea of Jesus being born at night is reflected in the fact that Christmas Eve is referred to as Heilige Nacht (Holy Night) in German, Nochebuena (the Good Night) in Spanish and similarly in other expressions of Christmas spirituality, such as the song \"Silent Night, Holy Night\".\n Many other varying cultural traditions and experiences are also associated with Christmas Eve around the world, including the gathering of family and friends, the singing of Christmas carols, the illumination and enjoyment of Christmas lights, trees, and other decorations, the wrapping and/or opening of gifts, and general preparation for Christmas Day. Legendary Christmas gift-bearing figures including Santa Claus, Father Christmas, Christkind, and Saint Nicholas are also often said to depart for their annual journey to deliver presents to children around the world on Christmas Eve, although until the Protestant introduction of Christkind in 16th-century Europe, such figures were said to instead deliver presents on the eve of Saint Nicholas' feast day (December 6).","recur":{"type":"DAY","value":1},"created_at":1476592678,"modified_at":1476592678},"category":4,"sub_category":0,"locations":[],"flags":0,"tags":[]},{"id":143,"euid":"eve144","name":"Christmas","property":{"webref":{"type":"WIKI","value":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas"},"description":"Christmas or Christmas Day (Old English: Crīstesmæsse, meaning \"Christ's Mass\") is an annual festival commemorating the birth of Jesus Christ, observed most commonly on December 25 as a religious and cultural celebration among billions of people around the world. A feast central to the Christian liturgical year, it is prepared for by the season of Advent or the Nativity Fast and initiates the season of Christmastide, which historically in the West lasts twelve days and culminates on Twelfth Night; in some traditions, Christmastide includes an Octave. Christmas Day is a public holiday in many of the world's nations, is celebrated culturally by a large number of non-Christian people, and is an integral part of the holiday season, while some Christian groups reject the celebration. In several countries, celebrating Christmas Eve on December 24 has the main focus rather than December 25, with gift-giving and sharing a traditional meal with the family.\n While the month and date of Jesus' birth are unknown, by the early-to-mid 4th century, the Western Christian Church had placed Christmas on December 25, a date later adopted in the East. Today, most Christians celebrate Christmas on the date of December 25 in the Gregorian calendar, which is also the calendar in near-universal use in the secular world. However, some Eastern churches celebrate Christmas on the December 25 of the older Julian calendar, which currently corresponds to January 7 in the Gregorian calendar, the day after the Western Christian Church celebrates the Epiphany. This is not a disagreement over the date of Christmas as such, but rather a disagreement over which calendar should be used to determine the day that is December 25. The date of Christmas may have initially been chosen to correspond with the day exactly nine months after the day on which early Christians believed that Jesus was conceived, or with one or more ancient polytheistic festivals that occurred near southern solstice (i.e., the Roman winter solstice); a further solar connection has been suggested because of a biblical verse identifying Jesus as the \"Sun of righteousness\".\n The celebratory customs associated in various countries with Christmas have a mix of pre-Christian, Christian, and secular themes and origins. Popular modern customs of the holiday include gift giving, completing an Advent calendar or Advent wreath, Christmas music and caroling, lighting a Christingle, an exchange of Christmas cards, church services, a special meal, and the display of various Christmas decorations, including Christmas trees, Christmas lights, nativity scenes, garlands, wreaths, mistletoe, and holly. In addition, several closely related and often interchangeable figures, known as Santa Claus, Father Christmas, Saint Nicholas, and Christkind, are associated with bringing gifts to children during the Christmas season and have their own body of traditions and lore. Because gift-giving and many other aspects of the Christmas festival involve heightened economic activity, the holiday has become a significant event and a key sales period for retailers and businesses. The economic impact of Christmas is a factor that has grown steadily over the past few centuries in many regions of the world.","recur":{"type":"DAY","value":1},"religion":"Christian","created_at":1476592678,"modified_at":1476592678},"category":6,"sub_category":0,"locations":[],"flags":0,"tags":[]},{"id":144,"euid":"eve145","name":"Shaheed Udham Singh's Birthday","property":{"webref":{"type":"WIKI","value":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Udham_Singh"},"description":"Udham Singh (26 December 1899 – 31 July 1940) was an Indian revolutionary best known for assassinating Michael O'Dwyer on 13 March 1940 in what has been described as an avenging of the Jallianwalla Bagh Massacre.
